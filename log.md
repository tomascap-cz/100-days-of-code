# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a rough sketch/prototype of Aerotrips, my shared flights website.

**Thoughts**
I'm not entirely new to coding, I have solid mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I never built any projects of my own that would be worth mentioning - not that I wasn't able to code them but the design phase always felt strange and unnatural for me - I just never felt like I had good ideas worth building and the ones I had, I usually quickly discarded for not being "good enough". So it's time for me now to "tough it out" and actually build some stuff, despite it maybe being dumb...we'll see. Today, I finally started working on a website showcasing my flying. I've wanted to start working on that one for a long time now so I feel pretty good about that.

### Day 2: December 29th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've added a background image for the page header and basic styling. I've also customized the settings of my VS Code.

**Thoughts**
After today's session, I have a very simple webpage. It's not polished or anything but it's not barebone either. It looks nice enough - for now. I bought a domain for it yesterday so despite it not being remotely finished, I am going to upload it to the internet and show it to the world - I need to get rid of my general fear of actually shipping my work.
