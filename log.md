# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a rough sketch/prototype of Aerotrips, my shared flights website.

**Thoughts**
I'm not entirely new to coding, I have solid mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I never built any projects of my own that would be worth mentioning - not that I wasn't able to code them but the design phase always felt strange and unnatural for me - I just never felt like I had good ideas worth building and the ones I had, I usually quickly discarded for not being "good enough". So it's time for me now to "tough it out" and actually build some stuff, despite it maybe being dumb...we'll see. Today, I finally started working on a website showcasing my flying. I've wanted to start working on that one for a long time now so I feel pretty good about that.

### Day 2: December 29th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've added a background image for the page header and basic styling. I've also customized the settings of my VS Code.

**Thoughts**
After today's session, I have a very simple webpage. It's not polished or anything but it's not barebone either. It looks nice enough - for now. I bought a domain for it yesterday so despite it not being remotely finished, I am going to upload it to the internet and show it to the world - I need to get rid of my general fear of actually shipping my work.

### Day 3: December 30th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've added external fonts, refactored CSS, tweaked the site content (new picture and changed texts), and made the site responsive for mobile devices.

**Thoughts**
After today, I believe the site looks pretty good - on desktop as well as on mobile. I enjoyed making all the small changes but ended up spending way more time with it than the one hour required by the challenge rules. That makes me neglect my other duties at home and my wife grumpy so I'd rather stick to the 60-minute limit with more discipline in the future.

### Day 4: December 31st, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I've added more content to my webpage.

**Thoughts**
It's the last day of the year - we're away from home, ready to celebrate New Year's Eve at our friends' place in the mountains. There's almost no cell reception and no wifi so there's only so much I can do (but I'm happy that I didn't skip the day altogether!). I've had to download the .zip of my project off GitHub while connected to my phone's hotspot when we were shopping in the town. And I am working offline now, editing the code in Notepad! Happy New Year!

### Day 5: January 1st, 2022, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a to-do of additional pages and features that need to be done. I've added a nav menu to the topbar and started implementing a hamburger button with a slidedown menu for mobile screens.

**Thoughts**
I've had an amazing New Year's Day: I got to read a great book, work on my website, have a lovely walk with my closest friends, cook a good-enough lunch (first in ages), and come back to my lovely home and be grateful and happy.

I am confident enough to implement my own solutions (like the mobile menu), at least when it comes to relatively simple HTML/CSS problems, but I also need to set aside some time to look at how others did it - I will likely find more polished, more robust approaches that will teach me a lot.

**Link(s) to work**
[Aerotrips](http://aerotrips.cz/)

### Day 6: January 2nd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've finished the hamburger menu for mobile devices.

**Thoughts**
I've had a look at a few implementations of the hamburger menu and came up with a simple solution that serves me well for now. I'll try to dive deeper into it in the evening.

### Day 7: January 3rd, Monday

**Today's Progress**
I took a break from the Aerotrips website and made just a quick HTML/CSS course assignment.

**Thoughts**
I've got a toothache and also a pretty difficult task at work. After I wrapped it up, I was pretty tired so I just finished my course assignments and called it a day. Week 1 of the challenge is done!

### Day 8: January 4th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've learned about Java Spring projects and logging with slf4j/Logback. I also progressed in my 100 Days Of Code web development course.

**Thoughts**
I need to step up my learning in Java and Spring/Spring Boot. It is important for my work, I don't want to be a burden on the team. So I took a little detour today and dedicated an hour to my Spring course. Good news is that I made a big progress today - both during work and my after-work learning efforts - with my understanding of POM files, module versioning, dependencies, and how the remote Maven repository plays into all of this.

### Day 9: January 5th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've got deeper into Spring application inner workings, started learning about PHP and WordPress, and started reviewing Git practices.

**Thoughts**
I started off 2022 with a big bang - trying to do well in my job, still learn coding, spend time with my family, keep the house at least fairly close to being tidy, cutting out Coke, McDonald's, and sweets from my diet...the result was that I was tired and generally miserable these last few days. Today, however, I am finally starting to feel normally again - my mood is better and I am not tired despite staying up some two hours longer than the days before. Let's keep it up :)

### Day 10: January 6th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've focused on how discarding/reverting changes and commits works in Git.

**Thoughts**
Didn't have much time but I was able to get a pretty good, detailed look at some Git commands that I only used a few times, if ever. I am pretty okay with my basic Git workflow (I use it daily both in and outside of work), but other than that, I have only very basic knowledge. Feels good to be able to dive deeper into the inner workings of this important tool.

### Day 11: January 7th, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I've started working on another project - graphical calculator.

**Thoughts**
After not coding any projects for a few days, I felt eager to start working on something. And I always wanted to code a nice-looking calculator, so here I go. Right now I have a basic structure of the keypad and a display (without any styles as of now). And I gained a very good insight into the behaviour of flex - by default, it will shrink if the window is resized, but it will not grow, therefore leaving some excess space in its container which messes up the alignment with other elements. Insights like this one are precisely what I like about this challenge - it allows me to fill various blanks in my knowledge.

### Day 12: January 8th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've added styles and basic calculation capability with results logged in the console.

**Thoughts**
Had to postpone this one because we had friends over on Saturday and then we actually went to their place for another round of board games and ended up sleeping over (wanted to be disciplined and took my notebook with me to code but didn't want to be rude).

### Day 13: January 9th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I've completed a round of changes on Janka's website and I've continued working on the calculator.

**Thoughts**
Did a ton of work today. Not just on my practice project but also on a real-world website I made a while ago for Janka's business which needed some updates. Learned something new regarding Angular's routing with fragments for navigating to anchors and also about using lazy loading for shortening the page load times (just read about it though, I haven't implemented it yet). And the calculator both works and looks pretty good now. I'll try to add some advanced/scientific functions in the coming days.

### Day 14: January 10th, Monday

**Today's Progress**
I've had a look at Bootstrap and put together a simple blog homepage. I also made some long overdue changes on Jirka's law firm's website.

**Thoughts**
The 100 Days of Code course I'm following does a great job explaining the basics in great detail but even though sometimes I find a useful bit of information there, usually I already know most of the stuff covered. I need to supplement this with UI libraries, frontend frameworks and other advanced stuff. That's why I started revising my (rusty) knowledge of Bootstrap today. I was able to put together a prototype of a blog page with a hero section and a grid of blog posts very quickly. I need to follow up with a detailed look at Bootstrap classes so that I can actually use Bootstrap and not just copy components from its website.

### Day 15: January 11th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've started to look at UI libraries for React, starting with React-Bootstrap. Additionally, I've learned some basic stuff about creating custom WordPress templates.

**Thoughts**
I understand how React-Bootstrap works but for some reason it seems unfriendly and intimidating to me. Some classes included in the documentation do not work...I'll try to soldier on tomorrow and create a polished blog UI with it but I didn't enjoy it too much today. Learning to create custom WordPress templates was much more rewarding. Anyway - I've entered my third week of the challenge, that's a success!

### Day 16: January 12th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've progressed with my WordPress course and created a homepage of my sample WP template.

**Thoughts**
I resolved my concerns about all the projects I've started during this challenge so far. I am not going to pursue the Aerotrips blog, I don't want to have to constantly update Aerotrips with new content, at least not at this point. Blogging still intrigues me so I will create a sample blog project but it will be simpler, without all the extra Aerotrips stuff. So going forward, I'm going to work on these projects: Aerotrips, Calculator, WordPress Website, and Blog (later). This way, the projects won't overlap and all of them will make sense independently of the others. Also, I might end up liking WordPress!

### Day 17: January 13th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've continued to code the sample WordPress template, discovering different built-in WordPress functions along the way.

**Thoughts**
I'm tired and sleepy after tonight's session of badminton with friends but I did NOT skip my training - I'm proud. I'm enjoying working with WordPress more and more, once you're approaching it as a coder and are not left with WP's UI to create your website, it's pretty awesome.

### Day 18: January 14th, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I've learned to convert static templates to actual WordPress pages, establish relationships between them, linking them up, and more.

**Thoughts**
It's my birthday! I'm 33. I've had an awesome day full of fun stuff to do - I went flying, I spent time with my son, and my girl has prepared this awesome party for tonight. In the end, I was not able to spend the full hour on coding as required by the challenge but I will make up for it tomorrow. I'm starting to have a pretty good idea how to work with WordPress and actually use its strengths instead of being constantly frustrated by its weak spots. Once one combines WordPress with custom code, it's actually amazing.

### Day 19: January 15th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've returned to my web development course and picked up a few handy CSS tricks. I also continued in my Java Spring tutorial, further understanding the concept of beans and dependency injections.

**Thoughts**
It's been a slow day - to be expected after last night's party. Anyway, even though I'm still learning a lot, I haven't been as productive project-wise these last few days so that's going to change tomorrow. I'll try to complete my mock blog homepage with React/React-Bootstrap and then we'll see. But I don't want to end up a slave to this challenge, I need to find a way to keep it light and fun.

### Day 20: January 16th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I've reworked my blog homepage.

**Thoughts**
I'm starting to enjoy React-Bootstrap. I've figured out how to use it (I have to target use underlying CSS classes, not the component names, as CSS selectors) and I'm now able to not just use the basic components but I can also redesign them with CSS and create custom ones if needed.
Also, 20% of the challenge completed!

### Day 21: January 17th, Monday

**Today's Progress**
I've started refactoring the blog homepage, splitting it into components.

**Thoughts**
Didn't have much time for today's training, I was working late. Also, it's been a long time since I last dabbled with React so I have to watch a couple of videos from my older course to get back into it.

### Day 22: January 18th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've tried to dynamically render Carousel items but ran into problems.

**Thoughts**
So there are apparently some issues with the way React-Bootstrap carousel is implemented, as soon as I switched from hard-coded Carousel slides to dynamically rendered ones (with .map()), I received an error related to React's ref() vs. futureRef() methods. I tried to read up on it but I don't really understand it at this point, I need to get more proficient in React first. I'll try to find another Carousel package tomorrow.

### Day 23: January 19th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've tried a couple of different Carousels and ended up going with React Slick.

**Thoughts**
Had a crappy day - spent almost 12 hours working. I did manage to eventually do what was needed but I don't really want to live like this. Anyway, I managed to find an easy-to-use Carousel package and implement it (though I still have a lot of customizing to do). I'll try to wrap this little project up in 1-2 dyas and move on to other stuff.

### Day 24: January 20th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've caught up with my web development course.

**Thoughts**
I actually chose to spend my Thursday evening with Janka so I had to catch up on Friday. I finished the initial part of the course which was trivial and a little boring to me, but still brought a few interesting insights. Right now I'm in the middle of a design-related module with tips on how to make good-looking designs and after that, the difficulty will start to go up. Looking forward to it!

### Day 25: January 21st, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I've made progress in my Java and WordPress Developer courses.

**Thoughts**
Got a little fed up with Maxmilian's web development course as the pace of the first few sections is rather slow. Instead, I completed a coding exercise in Java (returning to my general Java course for the first time during this challenge) and then continued with the WordPress course which seems super fun to me.

### Day 26: January 22nd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've finished my React-Bootstrap blog project and did some reading on color theory and website design best practices.

**Thoughts**
We're quarantined with Covid that our little guy brought from pre-school. Perfect time for house chores and also for some extra learning - and I really did plenty today. I need to get back to all the stuff I read with regard to the use of colors in webdesign and write down some takeaways. I also wrapped up my blog project - I got it to the point where it looks good enough for the time being and I actually don't want to wrestle with it anymore. I need to renew and expand my understanding of React anyway, before I dive into more complicated projects.

### Day 27: January 23rd, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I've learned about some of more advanced Git commands (for me, anyway) and I also created a contact form for my Aerotrips website.

**Thoughts**
I managed to find myself a problem - a CSS problem. Somehow, the padding of my section element containing the form does not work - it does not push the entire form up and inside the element, the form Submit button is inside the padding. I went back to my course lessons that dealt with margin and padding issues of inline elements and the solution actually helped - I eventually applied display: inline-block to the form element but that can't be it. There are no inline elements involved and the form is, of course, a block element by default. I finally had to let it go because it was super late and I wasn't thinking straight.

### Day 28: January 24th, Monday

**Today's Progress**
I've solved my form-related CSS problem and made a number of little visual tweaks to the Aerotrips website.

**Thoughts**
So the solution of my problem was easy - I was distracted by the seemingly obvious inline vs. inline-block issue but the real reason was that I assigned float: right to my button. Float takes the element out of the page flow, same as position: absolute. Watch out for that! After I figured it out, the world started to make sense to me again. Subsequently I created some simple transitions for the nav menu and the form Submit button. I believe the page is done for the time being! I need to complete other pages for the site and then also introduce some dynamic capabilites (like form handling), and in some time I will rewrite it in React or a different library, but for now, it's fine just the way it is.

### Day 29: January 25th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've coded a newsletter sign-up form based on a course challenge.

**Thoughts**
I am pretty confident that I can code just about anything with HTML and CSS. I need to dive deeper though - make sure that not only it's done, but that it's done in accordance with best practices, in the best possible way. There's still some visual stuff to fine-tune and then I guess I'll maybe use it in one of my future projects.

### Day 30: January 26th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've finished my newsletter sign-up form.

**Thoughts**
Today I fine-tuned the styling (after some inspiration from the course solution) and added validations to the form. In the process, I learned basics of regular expressions thanks to the telephone field. And in my web development course, I am finally progressing from HTML+CSS to JavaScript!

### Day 31: January 27th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've finished the JavaScript intro section in my webdev course and implemented a language switcher for Jirka's WordPress-based business website.

**Thoughts**
I'm back on track - I flew through the initial JS section of the course a day early. Also, I made it a full month into the challenge - nice! That's already a pretty consistent habit. Now I'll want to become more organized, ensuring that not only I don't skip my daily coding practice, but also that I don't overspend too much time on it (and miss other important stuff). So I'll permit myself to spend a total of up to one hour on actual hands-on coding and 30 minutes on tutorials and/or reading. Other than that, I have plenty of other stuff to take care of at home and it's just as important - or more (like spending time with my little guy!).

### Day 32: January 28th, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I'm diving deeper to the JavaScript section of the course and I've returned to my calculator project - I added new keys and enabled keyboard inputs.

**Thoughts**
Everything is great at home, our COVID quarantine is almost over and everyone's fine. And I'm happy with my progress today, too - although I busted my time limit (but to be fair, I watched some aviation videos on a second screen so I'll cut myself some slack for tonight - had a good time).

### Day 33: January 29th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've implemented the calculator functional key operations.

**Thoughts**
I've expanded the functionality of my calculator with all the functional key operations and to do that, I had a quick look and various methods of JavaScript's Math library. I've also progressed with my web development course - listening to lessons about DOM manipulation, events, and events listeners.

### Day 34: January 30th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I've refactored the calculator code.

**Thoughts**
I've got rid of cumbersome onclick attributes on every single button and switched to event listeners. Apart from that, I made a few other changes in all my files - HTML, CSS, and JS - and I think the calculator works fine now.

**Today's Progress**
I finished the control flow section of my course and started reading Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts**
I finished another course chapter and I'm about to start with a new "milestone" project - the tic tac toe game. And I started to read the Eloquent JavaScript book which is very well written.

### Day 37: February 2nd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I started working on the Tic Tac Toe game.

**Thoughts**
I created the first HTML structure and some basic styling. I did it myself first and only then watched the course videos (to not get influenced by them). I think I did a decent job but I will have to refactor and simplify it tomorrow. I've got some good inspiration from the video afterwards - and I could see I still have a lot to improve both in the analysis and the implementation. No biggie, I'll figure it out.

### Day 38: February 3rd, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I tweaked Tic Tac Toe's appearance, refactored HTML and CSS, and started implementing JavaScript.

**Thoughts**
Yesterday it felt awkward to work on this project and I was leaving it unhappy about what I accomplished. Today I like it much better - the application looks the way I want and I am implementing the game functionality. One or two more days and I'm done.

### Day 39: February 4th, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I watched the instructor's implementation of Tic Tac Toe.

**Thoughts**
I took some time today to compare the course instructor's implementation of the Tic Tac Toe project with my own, figuring out whether I got various parts wrong, less practical, or just different. My coding abilities are improving and I think I am starting to think in a more complex way - it's not anymore about making it just work, it's about writing a good, efficient code now.

### Day 40: February 5th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I put some finishing touches on my Tic Tac Toe game.

**Thoughts**
I am done with my Tic Tac Toe project. I'm sure it's far from perfect but it's good enough for me to be quite happy with it. I learned a lot. Perhaps I can revisit it in some time and try to make the implementation more elegant after I internalize all the differences I got from the course videos.

### Day 41: February 6th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I moved on to backend development and I learned basics of Node.js and Express.js.

**Thoughts**
It's on! I "graduated" from the frontend part of the course which was pretty basic for me at this point. The backend part will be much more interesting, I have little knowledge there. And I managed to go through a ton of material today, returning to work with Node.js and Express.js after a very long time. To complement the lessons, I started a new project which I wanted to build for some time - a flashcard app. I'm excited!

### Day 42: February 7th, Monday

**Today's Progress**
I implemented a simple homepage for my flashcard project.

**Thoughts**
I'm working with Express and I like it. I also applied some styles for the project homepage.

### Day 43: February 8th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I implemented the flashcard page and I am starting to mess with EJS.

**Thoughts**
I've (re)discovered both advantages and shortcomings/limitations of EJS today. I'll have to have another look tomorrow. Also, I've had an interview for a company working for People in Need - it seems I'll be volunteering for them. Extra learning opportunities coming soon.

### Day 44: February 9th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I converted my brother's website from a collection of static HTML pages to a Node/Express application with frontend based on EJS templates.

**Thoughts**
I did the long needed upgrade to my brother's site. I also included a rudimentary "content management system" which will enable him to change the texts by himself. Made for a good training with Express and EJS, especially after realizing yesterday that EJS is not the way to go with flashcards - it would be a pain and the result would be cumbersome at best.

### Day 46: February 11th, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I started building my first app with Vue.js.

**Thoughts**
I received my first trial assignment from Quanti, a firm where I will be volunteering on behalf of People in Need. They want me to build a CRUD app for creating and displaying a list of notes (or todo items?). I've never worked with Vue so I started slow. Some of the concepts were quite difficult for me and there's still a lot of problems I need to solve but it's a start. I feel pretty dumb now, not to mention frustrated, but this is precisely what I need to get better in - making my way through the unknown, "embracing the suck", fighting through my impostor syndrome and just figure stuff out.

### Day 47: February 12th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I figured out a difficult issue and got my Vue app working.

**Thoughts**
My Vue app can now add items, display them either in a list or in a separate detail page. It's been difficult and frustrating but the side effect is that I am becoming better at Googling solutions to my problems and reading the documetation.

### Day 48: February 13th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I deployed a real-world project (my brother's website) to Heroku and figured out some additional requirements for the app I need to fulfill.

**Thoughts**
Turns out that an app hosted on Heroku needs to be hooked up to a database. So apart from Heroku I read up on MongoDB Atlas and mongoose. I also completed another section of the web development course which leaves me with a pretty decent knowledge of Express.
