# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a rough sketch/prototype of Aerotrips, my shared flights website.

**Thoughts**
I'm not entirely new to coding, I have solid mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I never built any projects of my own that would be worth mentioning - not that I wasn't able to code them but the design phase always felt strange and unnatural for me - I just never felt like I had good ideas worth building and the ones I had, I usually quickly discarded for not being "good enough". So it's time for me now to "tough it out" and actually build some stuff, despite it maybe being dumb...we'll see. Today, I finally started working on a website showcasing my flying. I've wanted to start working on that one for a long time now so I feel pretty good about that.

### Day 2: December 29th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've added a background image for the page header and basic styling. I've also customized the settings of my VS Code.

**Thoughts**
After today's session, I have a very simple webpage. It's not polished or anything but it's not barebone either. It looks nice enough - for now. I bought a domain for it yesterday so despite it not being remotely finished, I am going to upload it to the internet and show it to the world - I need to get rid of my general fear of actually shipping my work.

### Day 3: December 30th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've added external fonts, refactored CSS, tweaked the site content (new picture and changed texts), and made the site responsive for mobile devices.

**Thoughts**
After today, I believe the site looks pretty good - on desktop as well as on mobile. I enjoyed making all the small changes but ended up spending way more time with it than the one hour required by the challenge rules. That makes me neglect my other duties at home and my wife grumpy so I'd rather stick to the 60-minute limit with more discipline in the future.

### Day 4: December 31st, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I've added more content to my webpage.

**Thoughts**
It's the last day of the year - we're away from home, ready to celebrate New Year's Eve at our friends' place in the mountains. There's almost no cell reception and no wifi so there's only so much I can do (but I'm happy that I didn't skip the day altogether!). I've had to download the .zip of my project off GitHub while connected to my phone's hotspot when we were shopping in the town. And I am working offline now, editing the code in Notepad! Happy New Year!

### Day 5: January 1st, 2022, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a to-do of additional pages and features that need to be done. I've added a nav menu to the topbar and started implementing a hamburger button with a slidedown menu for mobile screens.

**Thoughts**
I've had an amazing New Year's Day: I got to read a great book, work on my website, have a lovely walk with my closest friends, cook a good-enough lunch (first in ages), and come back to my lovely home and be grateful and happy.

I am confident enough to implement my own solutions (like the mobile menu), at least when it comes to relatively simple HTML/CSS problems, but I also need to set aside some time to look at how others did it - I will likely find more polished, more robust approaches that will teach me a lot.

### Day 6: January 2nd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've finished the hamburger menu for mobile devices.

**Thoughts**
I've had a look at a few implementations of the hamburger menu and came up with a simple solution that serves me well for now. I'll try to dive deeper into it in the evening.

### Day 7: January 3rd, Monday

**Today's Progress**
I took a break from the Aerotrips website and made just a quick HTML/CSS course assignment.

**Thoughts**
I've got a toothache and also a pretty difficult task at work. After I wrapped it up, I was pretty tired so I just finished my course assignments and called it a day. Week 1 of the challenge is done!
