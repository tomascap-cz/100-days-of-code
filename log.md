# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a rough sketch/prototype of Aerotrips, my shared flights website.

**Thoughts**
I'm not entirely new to coding, I have solid mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I never built any projects of my own that would be worth mentioning - not that I wasn't able to code them but the design phase always felt strange and unnatural for me - I just never felt like I had good ideas worth building and the ones I had, I usually quickly discarded for not being "good enough". So it's time for me now to "tough it out" and actually build some stuff, despite it maybe being dumb...we'll see. Today, I finally started working on a website showcasing my flying. I've wanted to start working on that one for a long time now so I feel pretty good about that.
