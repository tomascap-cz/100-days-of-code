# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a rough sketch/prototype of Aerotrips, my shared flights website.

**Thoughts**
I'm not entirely new to coding, I have solid mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I never built any projects of my own that would be worth mentioning - not that I wasn't able to code them but the design phase always felt strange and unnatural for me - I just never felt like I had good ideas worth building and the ones I had, I usually quickly discarded for not being "good enough". So it's time for me now to "tough it out" and actually build some stuff, despite it maybe being dumb...we'll see. Today, I finally started working on a website showcasing my flying. I've wanted to start working on that one for a long time now so I feel pretty good about that.

### Day 2: December 29th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've added a background image for the page header and basic styling. I've also customized the settings of my VS Code.

**Thoughts**
After today's session, I have a very simple webpage. It's not polished or anything but it's not barebone either. It looks nice enough - for now. I bought a domain for it yesterday so despite it not being remotely finished, I am going to upload it to the internet and show it to the world - I need to get rid of my general fear of actually shipping my work.

### Day 3: December 30th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've added external fonts, refactored CSS, tweaked the site content (new picture and changed texts), and made the site responsive for mobile devices.

**Thoughts**
After today, I believe the site looks pretty good - on desktop as well as on mobile. I enjoyed making all the small changes but ended up spending way more time with it than the one hour required by the challenge rules. That makes me neglect my other duties at home and my wife grumpy so I'd rather stick to the 60-minute limit with more discipline in the future.

### Day 4: December 31st, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I've added more content to my webpage.

**Thoughts**
It's the last day of the year - we're away from home, ready to celebrate New Year's Eve at our friends' place in the mountains. There's almost no cell reception and no wifi so there's only so much I can do (but I'm happy that I didn't skip the day altogether!). I've had to download the .zip of my project off GitHub while connected to my phone's hotspot when we were shopping in the town. And I am working offline now, editing the code in Notepad! Happy New Year!

### Day 5: January 1st, 2022, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've made a to-do of additional pages and features that need to be done. I've added a nav menu to the topbar and started implementing a hamburger button with a slidedown menu for mobile screens.

**Thoughts**
I've had an amazing New Year's Day: I got to read a great book, work on my website, have a lovely walk with my closest friends, cook a good-enough lunch (first in ages), and come back to my lovely home and be grateful and happy.

I am confident enough to implement my own solutions (like the mobile menu), at least when it comes to relatively simple HTML/CSS problems, but I also need to set aside some time to look at how others did it - I will likely find more polished, more robust approaches that will teach me a lot.

### Day 6: January 2nd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've finished the hamburger menu for mobile devices.

**Thoughts**
I've had a look at a few implementations of the hamburger menu and came up with a simple solution that serves me well for now. I'll try to dive deeper into it in the evening.

### Day 7: January 3rd, Monday

**Today's Progress**
I took a break from the Aerotrips website and made just a quick HTML/CSS course assignment.

**Thoughts**
I've got a toothache and also a pretty difficult task at work. After I wrapped it up, I was pretty tired so I just finished my course assignments and called it a day. Week 1 of the challenge is done!

### Day 8: January 4th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
I've learned about Java Spring projects and logging with slf4j/Logback. I also progressed in my 100 Days Of Code web development course.

**Thoughts**
I need to step up my learning in Java and Spring/Spring Boot. It is important for my work, I don't want to be a burden on the team. So I took a little detour today and dedicated an hour to my Spring course. Good news is that I made a big progress today - both during work and my after-work learning efforts - with my understanding of POM files, module versioning, dependencies, and how the remote Maven repository plays into all of this.

### Day 9: January 5th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
I've got deeper into Spring application inner workings, started learning about PHP and WordPress, and started reviewing Git practices.

**Thoughts**
I started off 2022 with a big bang - trying to do well in my job, still learn coding, spend time with my family, keep the house at least fairly close to being tidy, cutting out Coke, McDonald's, and sweets from my diet...the result was that I was tired and generally miserable these last few days. Today, however, I am finally starting to feel normally again - my mood is better and I am not tired despite staying up some two hours longer than the days before. Let's keep it up :)

### Day 10: January 6th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
I've focused on how discarding/reverting changes and commits works in Git.

**Thoughts**
Didn't have much time but I was able to get a pretty good, detailed look at some Git commands that I only used a few times, if ever. I am pretty okay with my basic Git workflow (I use it daily both in and outside of work), but other than that, I have only very basic knowledge. Feels good to be able to dive deeper into the inner workings of this important tool.

### Day 11: January 7th, Friday

**Today's Progress**
I've started working on another project - graphical calculator.

**Thoughts**
After not coding any projects for a few days, I felt eager to start working on something. And I always wanted to code a nice-looking calculator, so here I go. Right now I have a basic structure of the keypad and a display (without any styles as of now). And I gained a very good insight into the behaviour of flex - by default, it will shrink if the window is resized, but it will not grow, therefore leaving some excess space in its container which messes up the alignment with other elements. Insights like this one are precisely what I like about this challenge - it allows me to fill various blanks in my knowledge.

### Day 12: January 8th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
I've added styles and basic calculation capability with results logged in the console.

**Thoughts**
Had to postpone this one because we had friends over on Saturday and then we actually went to their place for another round of board games and ended up sleeping over (wanted to be disciplined and took my notebook with me to code but didn't want to be rude).

### Day 13: January 9th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I've completed a round of changes on Janka's website and I've continued working on the calculator.

**Thoughts**
Did a ton of work today. Not just on my practice project but also on a real-world website I made a while ago for Janka's business which needed some updates. Learned something new regarding Angular's routing with fragments for navigating to anchors and also about using lazy loading for shortening the page load times (just read about it though, I haven't implemented it yet). And the calculator both works and looks pretty good now. I'll try to add some advanced/scientific functions in the coming days.
